This project aimed to identify key customer segments most likely to purchase organic products and develop data-driven marketing strategies to increase sales. Using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost), we analyzed customer demographics, spending patterns, and loyalty data to determine which factors influence organic purchases. The results showed that affluent customers, younger consumers, and gender-specific preferences play a significant role in organic product adoption. Among the models tested, XGBoost (Fine-Tuned) provided the best balance of accuracy (81.81%) and precision (74.19%), making it the most effective for predicting organic buyers. Feature importance analysis confirmed that affluence, gender, and age were the strongest predictors of organic purchasing behavior.

Based on these insights, we recommend implementing a tiered loyalty program, personalizing promotions based on gender and spending behavior, and shifting from region-based targeting to behavior-driven segmentation. Women respond better to health and sustainability-focused marketing, while men are more likely to purchase fitness-related organic products. High-spending customers should receive VIP organic offers, while budget-conscious shoppers should be incentivized with discounts and bundles. Additionally, younger consumers can be targeted through digital engagement and influencer partnerships. These strategies will enhance customer engagement, optimize marketing spend, and maximize revenue, ensuring a successful expansion of organic product sales.
